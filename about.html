                            <p> You are not alone! The use of Screams for mental and physical relief may not be a new concept but our company, Screams, uses this to our advantage. Screaming- though releaving- is not accepted in all places, for example an office building. With the help of our naturally sourced screams we provide a way to keep the benifits of releasing these emotions while taking away the disruptiveness.</p>

                                <p>Our screams are ethiclly sourced from our scream farms. These screams taken directly from our employees, whom live in farm style cubbies,  masks that are connected to their mouths where they then scream. The screams are then transported through tubes into jars which then are vacum sealed and labled for our costumers to purchase in local retail stores/gas staions. Although we keep the hygine of our product top priority it is reccomended to wash the jars before usage incase of the possiblity dirt collecting from shipping.</p>
